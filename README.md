# SSLRP
**SSLRP** stands for **Sewer Service Line Replacement Program**.  It's a program whereby homeowners can apply for reimbursement for part, or all, of the cost to replace their sewer service line.  This is done to reduce storm water infiltration into the sewer system.  

This map/app was created to provide city directors a way too view the SSLRP program numbers for their wards. 

Each night a SQL query is run and the result is written to HTML files for each ward and and overall total.

These are then read within <iframe> </iframe> tags in the app.

Live version can be viewed [here](https://gis.lrwu.com/sslrp/).
